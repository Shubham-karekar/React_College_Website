                Sarhad was founded by the visionary, Shri. Sanjay Nahar and on
                its advisory board are eminent & distinguished persons like
                Shri. Anna Hazare, social activist and Mr. Julio Ribeiro, former
                Director General, Punjab Police. Facing all odds to achieve his
                vision, he has been awarded the “Bridges of Humanity Award” by
                the minister of agriculture, Jammu & Kashmir, “Ba-Bapu Award” by
                Gandhi National Memorial Society, Pune in 2012, such is his
                zeal. His mission in life has been “to work towards bonding
                people and communities together.” An humble, simple human being
                that he is, he has been appreciated for his work by three former
                Prime Ministers of India, Shri. Rajiv Gandhi, Shri.
                Chandrasekhar and Shri. I.K.Gujral. He has helped hundreds of
                kashmiri youth to get admissions in not only Sarhad but other
                educational institutions also in Pune. Through the NGO, Vande
                Mataram, he works for the betterment of the youth from the
                strife torn regions. Sarhad was founded with a unique and
                different purpose of providing education to the kashmiri youth
                as they are from the strife torn region. Sarhad was founded in
                1995 to take care of the kashmiri youth who don’t get misled on
                the wrong path of violence. Instead, they can take formal
                education in Pune which is known as the ‘oxford of the east’,
                under the affiliated, Savitribai Phule Pune University. Sarhad’s
                vision also covers the deprived students from Ladakh, Manipur,
                Nagaland, Bihar and Assam in order to bring them into the
                mainstream of education. Being in the heart of the city suburb
                of katraj, there are number of local students who come from
                economically challenged families. As the fees structure is less
                at Sarhad College, they can avail this opportunity and empower
                themselves with the best education and learning. Sarhad College
                of Arts, Commerce & Science was formally established in 2008. It
                is an educational institution focusing on global, social and
                cultural aspects. It is affiliated to Savitribai Phule Pune
                University. The college conducts B. Com., B.A., BSc. (Computer
                Science), B.B.A., B.B.A. (C.A.), M. Com., M.Sc. (Computer
                Science) and B.Sc. (regular) programs with various
                specializations.
